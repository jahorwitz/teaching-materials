# Week 5 Code Samples

Use these examples to follow along with the lecture slides.


## 5.1 JavaScript App Setup

Included in this repo is a code sample for a completely setup node application. The application here includes two modules. One of them has been fully covered with unit tests to illustrate an example of some Mocha tests. In the unit tests, API calls to the json placeholder API have been stubbed using a library called sinon.

## 5.2 Compilation with Webpack

Included here is a sample application utilizing webpack for compilation. The lecture slides walk you through creating this application and configuring the webpack.config.js file, but this is an example of a working project.
